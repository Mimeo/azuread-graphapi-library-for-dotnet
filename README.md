azuread-graphapi-library-for-dotnet
===================================
Microsoft Azure Active Directory Graph API Version 1.0 library sources. Anyone who would like to add their contributions to this library, please do this using the "Dev" branch (not the Master branch).

This library is recommended for any dev projects that will call the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Graph API. 

This library uses Json.NET (https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) - if you refresh your NuGet packages for this solution, it will update the Json.NET package - Note: auto update for NuGet is turned on by default, unless you've disable this functionality.  
The following sample apps demonstrate how to call the Graph API using this library: 

1. Console App that shows Read and Write operations, using Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)
https://github.com/AzureADSamples/ConsoleApp-GraphAPI-DotNet  

2. MVC Web App that calls Graph API, using OpenID connect and OWIN libraries
https://github.com/AzureADSamples/WebApp-GraphAPI-DotNet

We welcome all feedback and questions. We also welcome fixes, enhancements - please make contributions using the Dev branch of this library.  

Thank you, from the Microsoft Azure AD Graph team.
